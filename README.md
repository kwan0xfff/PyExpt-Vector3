# PyExpt-Vector3
Experiments in using Python to handle fixed-length short numeric vectors,
such as a 3-element Cartesian vector.

Experiments include:
* Python native language features
* generating Python interface to C++ via SWIG

At the current time, the environment for these experiments is:
* Ubuntu 16.04
* GCC/G++ 5.4.0
* Python 3.5.2
* SWIG 3.0.8

## Experiments

### Python `array` data type

See section 8.7 `array` of Python docuentation.

### C++ scalars mapped into Python by SWIG.


## SWIG

Many of the experiments make use of SWIG
(Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator, http://www.swig.org),
a popular tool for generating scripting language interfaces
to application or library code written in C/C++.

### Documentation

The SWIG-3.0 Documentation provides a wealth of information.
It is found in two forms:

* single PDF, 653 pages:  http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/SWIGDocumentation.pdf
* single HTML:  http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/SWIGDocumentation.html
* HTML sections, contents list at:  http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/Sections.html

The following is a list of documents or sections which are particularly
useful for the experiments done here.
URLs refer into the HTML sections.
